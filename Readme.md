##This game's story
<p>You are someone with Alzheimers who wakes up inside your own brain. You then are allowed to adventure around inside your brain. Along the way you encounter items, enemies, friendlies all of which won't take themselves seriously.</p>

<p>The goal of the game is up to you. You can choose to leave an enemy alive at the risk of not having food/energy to continue playing. However if you do clear a room or kill an enemy you will be rewarded with part of your memory being recovered. Once you reach the end you will be cured of Alzheimers</p>
